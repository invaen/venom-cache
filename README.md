# Security Research & Tooling

I build tools for offensive security — reconnaissance, static analysis, attack surface monitoring, and payload engineering. Everything is zero-dependency Python designed to integrate into existing bug bounty and penetration testing workflows.

Currently studying cybersecurity at **TalTech** (Tallinn University of Technology).

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **[ghost-recon](https://github.com/invaen/ghost-recon)** | Reconnaissance with intelligent analysis — subdomain discovery, tech fingerprinting, and a reasoning layer that prioritizes findings |
| **[js-surgeon](https://github.com/invaen/js-surgeon)** | JavaScript static analysis — extracts secrets, API endpoints, and security anti-patterns from JS files |
| **[diff-hunter](https://github.com/invaen/diff-hunter)** | Attack surface monitoring — continuous tracking of subdomain changes, endpoint exposure, and configuration drift |
| **[context-cannon](https://github.com/invaen/context-cannon)** | Context-aware payload generation — XSS, SQLi, SSTI, SSRF, LFI with filter bypass and encoding |

## Focus Areas

- Web application security
- Reconnaissance automation
- JavaScript analysis
- Attack surface management
- Vulnerability research
